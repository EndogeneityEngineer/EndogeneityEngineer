## About Me
- **Location**: I am based in London, UK.
- **Language Skills**: Fluent in both English and Spanish.
- **Academic Background**: I am strongly grounded in financial mathematics and economics, with particular interests in macro-finance, international trade, and advanced econometric methods.
- **Current Focus**:
  - Applying **machine learning** approaches (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting, and deep learning) to improve macroeconomic forecasting.
  - Investigating **global financial markets** through dynamic time-series modelling (e.g., VAR, SVAR, FAVAR).
  - Delving into **international trade** determinants using a blend of classical econometric and data-driven frameworks.
- **Skills in Development**:
  - Advanced Python workflows for large-scale data analysis (including distributed computing).
  - Bayesian estimation, GMM, and other cutting-edge econometric methods.

## Selected Projects and Interests
Here are some examples—actual or forthcoming—of the work I pursue:

1. **Macro-Finance Analysis**  
   - **Goal**: Examine how shifts in monetary policy influence asset prices, using both structural and reduced-form VAR techniques.  
   - **Tools**: Python (`statsmodels`, `linearmodels`), with potential machine learning enhancements.

2. **International Trade & Gravity Models**  
   - **Goal**: Identify key drivers of bilateral trade flows, employing the classical gravity framework and modern ML algorithms.  
   - **Tools**: Python or R, focusing on panel data and advanced regression methods.

3. **Asset Pricing & GMM**  
   - **Goal**: Investigate standard factor models (CAPM, Fama-French) in a GMM framework, potentially augmented by ML-based factor selection.  
   - **Tools**: Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `arch` or `linearmodels`), or R for empirical finance.

4. **Causal Inference with Machine Learning**  
   - **Goal**: Implement methods such as double machine learning or causal forests to evaluate policy interventions (e.g., minimum wage changes).  
   - **Comparisons**: Benchmark against classical approaches (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, Synthetic Control) to highlight ML advantages.
