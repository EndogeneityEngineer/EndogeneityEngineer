## 🚀 Selected Research & Projects

### 🔍 QE & UK Manufacturing  
**MSc Econometrics**  
- Developed and estimated an ARDL–ECM on 126 monthly observations (Jul 2009–Dec 2019) to isolate short- and long-run effects of BoE QE stock on manufacturing output and bank lending.  
- Selected lags via AIC, implemented the error-correction form, and conducted Pesaran–Shin bounds tests (no cointegration detected).  
- Ran diagnostic checks (Ljung–Box, ARCH, Jarque–Bera) to verify model validity.  
- Found ∆ln GVA drives short-run output changes while QE and lending flows were insignificant—indicating a weak lending channel and the need for targeted credit policy.

### ⚙️ Fiscal Policy in Dynare  
**MSc Macroeconomics**  
- Configured a Baxter–King DSGE model in Dynare with adaptive consumption, labour-income and capital-income tax rules calibrated to UK steady-state targets.  
- Simulated 40-period impulse-response functions to shocks in each tax instrument, analysing impacts on output, consumption, investment, capital stocks and labour supply.  
- Quantified distortionary effects and macro multipliers of alternative tax-financing schemes, informing optimal fiscal design.

### 📊 Dissertation: QE Transmission Channels  
**“Transmission Channels of Quantitative Easing to the UK Manufacturing Sector: A Dynamic Econometric Analysis (2009–2024)”**  
- **Research Question:** Assess how BoE QE programmes influenced UK manufacturing output via credit volumes, bond spreads and macro-financial channels, and how these effects varied across QE phases and sub-sectors.  
- **Data:** BoE QE Asset Purchase Facility holdings; ONS manufacturing indices; controls for inflation, exchange rates and Bank Rate.  
- **Methods:** ARDL models with error-correction to estimate long-run relationships; SVARs to trace dynamic transmission; robustness checks for structural breaks and sectoral heterogeneity; Python–BQL dashboard for real-time monitoring.
