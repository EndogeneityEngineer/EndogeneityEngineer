## About Me
- **Location**: I am based in London, UK.
- **Language Skills**: Fluent in both English and Spanish.
- **Academic Background**: I hold a strong grounding in financial mathematics and economics, with particular interests in macro-finance, international trade, and advanced econometric methods.
- **Current Focus**:
  - Applying **machine learning** approaches (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting, and deep learning) to improve macroeconomic forecasting.
  - Investigating **global financial markets** through dynamic time-series modelling (e.g., VAR, SVAR, FAVAR).
  - Delving into **international trade** determinants using a blend of classical econometric and data-driven frameworks.
- **Skills in Development**:
  - Advanced Python workflows for large-scale data analysis (including distributed computing).
  - Bayesian estimation, GMM, and other cutting-edge econometric methods.

## Selected Projects and Interests
Here are some examples—actual or forthcoming—of the work I pursue:

1. **Macro-Finance Analysis**  
   - **Goal**: Examine how shifts in monetary policy influence asset prices, using both structural and reduced-form VAR techniques.  
   - **Tools**: Python (`statsmodels`, `linearmodels`), with potential machine learning enhancements.

2. **International Trade & Gravity Models**  
   - **Goal**: Identify key drivers of bilateral trade flows, employing the classical gravity framework and modern ML algorithms.  
   - **Tools**: Python or R, focusing on panel data and advanced regression methods.

3. **Asset Pricing & GMM**  
   - **Goal**: Investigate standard factor models (CAPM, Fama-French) in a GMM framework, potentially augmented by ML-based factor selection.  
   - **Tools**: Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `arch` or `linearmodels`), or R for empirical finance.

4. **Causal Inference with Machine Learning**  
   - **Goal**: Implement methods such as double machine learning or causal forests to evaluate policy interventions (e.g., minimum wage changes).  
   - **Comparisons**: Benchmark against classical approaches (e.g., Diff-in-Diff, Synthetic Control) to highlight ML advantages.

*Please check back for updates—there are more projects in the pipeline!*

## Collaboration and Research
- **Collaborative Work**: I am open to co-authoring or contributing to research projects that bridge quantitative finance, econometric analysis, and data science.  
- **Potential Contributions**:
  - Enhancing open-source ML or econometric libraries.
  - Participating in discussions and reviews of research with substantial quantitative content.
  - Engaging in cross-disciplinary ventures (e.g., combining economics and NLP).
